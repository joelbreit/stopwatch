# Setup Breadcrumbs

This document explains how this project was initially set up, not how to use the template for new projects. For that, see the [README](../README.md) file.

1. Cloned My [Template for Web Apps](https://github.com/joelbreit/react-tailwind-template#)
2. Started a new git repo (`rm -rf .git`, `git init`)
3. Installed dependencies: `npm install`
4. That's it!
